# Arduino Library for Proteus


	Arduino microprocessor boards library for Proteus

	This will be the most complete library of all arduino libraries (in a near future).

#Library contents:
	Arduino Micro with:
			Simple simulation component (simulates only the microcontroller)
			Complete simulation component (include all pins, internal components and USB port)
			Internal circuit schematics.
			Packages with 3D models: headers only, soldered and arduino with headers.
						
			
			As soon as time lets me, I will update the library with other arduinos.
			Feel free to request the addition of any model.
			
	Arduino Nano V3 with:
			Internal circuit schematics.
